Hi, I’m @Hazarre

I build accessible data and digital tools and write content to help individuals learn about STEM and make data-driven decisions.

- I made [quantum.bard.edu](quantum.bard.edu/hc) to make learning quantum entanglement intuitive.
- I have worked as an associate DevOps Engineer at Morningstar Inc., Chicago. 
- 🌱 I studied Computer Science and Physics at Bard College, NY, and graduated in May 2023. 
- 👀 I’m interested in quantum computing, data visualization, computational physics, AI, sustainability, STEM education and fostering equal opportunities.
